# Text Categorization using Machine Learning on 20 Newsgroups Dataset
 This repository contains a comprehensive project on text categorization using machine learning, leveraging the 20 Newsgroups dataset. The task includes evaluating three classifiers (Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) and three feature extraction methods (Count, TF, TF-IDF). The optimal combination of Random Forest with TF-IDF was identified for superior performance. Detailed experiments explore hyperparameters, feature effects, and classifier efficiency, with results presented in terms of Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Scripts, results, and documentation are included for reproducibility and further exploration.
